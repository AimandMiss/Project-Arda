# Return-to-Arda
MLH To the moon and hack submission

Ever dreamt of exploring the far reaches of space? Now you can help an Ardanian return home with some intergalactic trivia! Can you get Eru to Arda? Try your hand at answering questions on deck.

Meet Eru Ukibo! A tiny little alien who lost their way home and wants your help in returning to Arda. They are a little mischievous, so they decided to explore the galaxy on their own and accidentally landed on the Earth.

You, Earthling, are the chosen one to help Eru! Suit up with your intergalactic language translators and set your phasers to stun before boarding the spaceship. 3, 2, 1 Take off!

Before you lift-off, take note of your battleships safety instructions and manual

1. Click on the question button once Eru lands to see the options
2. Hover over each option asteroid to see the choices
3. Answering it correctly results in the alien getting one step closer to home
4. As you move along space, the levels get harder and enemies increase
5. If you answer wrong, the game terminates and Eru didn't get home

May the force be with you, space trooper!
